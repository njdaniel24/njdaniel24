    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2><br>
    <p>Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work.I did study exotic tribal dance.To asnwer your question,my favourite dance are as follows,with definitions:</p><br>
    Polynesian chicken dance<br>
    <p>A little know but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around in a circle link chicken,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
    Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
    <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which involved huddling close together in circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies aroung in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements.One of the my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>
    Arctic robot dance<br>
    <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960 believed to have discoverd a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stilted movement,being practiced by inhabitants of the Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discoverd that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
